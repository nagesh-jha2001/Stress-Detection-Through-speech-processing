# Stress-Detection-Through-speech-processing
This project is based on detecting stress from speech files. The model used here is Random Forest and it is further integrated with a flask app to check its functionality. The UI is not so good as this was a research based project but still works well.
Please create an environment variable before going into flask and then continue.
NOTE- The machine learning code is not provided here, only the pickle file is uploaded. If you need help in getting that feel free to contact.
